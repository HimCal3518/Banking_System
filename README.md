Abstract Class      | `Account` is an abstract class, serves as a base for account types     |
Method Overriding   | `withdraw()` and `calculateInterest()` are overridden in child classes |
Constructors        | Used for initializing account details                                  |
Access Modifiers    | `protected` for class fields, `public` for methods                     |
Scanner Class       | To take user input                                                     |
Exception Handling  | `try-catch` blocks for safe input and crash prevention                 |
Collections API     | `HashMap` used to store accounts using account number as key           |
Control Flow        | `switch-case`, `while` loop, `if-else`                                 |
